# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here

1. Add custom id field to the Agent table
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        * Add a new field called "custom_id" to store the custom id assigned by the Facility.
        * The custom_id should be set Notnull and as Primarykey
    -Time/Effort estimate: About 2 hours
    -Implementation details:
        * Add the custom_id field to Agent table.
        * Update the Entity and Repository classes in the codebase to reflect the changes in the database schema.
2. Allow Facilities to assign custom ids to Agents
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        * The user interface for the Facility allows them to view and edit the custom id for each Agent they work with.
        * The custom ids are saved and persist in the database.
    - Time/Effort estimate: About 4 hours
    - Implementation details:
        * Add a new page in the user interface for the Facility to view and edit the custom id for each Agent.
        * Update the Controller and Service classes in the codebase to handle the logic for saving 	and retrieving the custom ids.
3. Use custom ids in generateReport function
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        * The generateReport function uses the custom id instead of the internal database id when generating reports for Facilities.
        * The reports generated by the function include the custom id for each Agent.
    - Time/Effort estimate: 2-4 hours
    - Implementation details:
        * Update the generateReport function in the codebase to use the custom id when generating reports for Facilities.
        * Modify the PDF template used by the function to include the custom id for each Agent.
4. Update documentation
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        * The documentation for the codebase includes information about the custom id field for Agents and how it is used in generating reports for Facilities.
    - Time/Effort estimate: 1-2 hours
    - Implementation details:
        * Update the code documentation to include information about the custom id field for Agents and how it is used in generating reports for Facilities.
5. Test and debug
    - Acceptance Criteria:
        * The codebase passes all unit and integration tests.
        * All functionality related to custom ids for Agents and generating reports works as expected.
    - Time/Effort estimate: 4-6 hours
    - Implementation details:
        *Write and run unit and integration tests to verify the functionality related to custom ids for sAgents and generating reports.
        *Debug and fix any issues found during testing.
